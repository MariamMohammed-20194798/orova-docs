The **Rewind Nodes** feature in the Canvas allows your chatbot to navigate back to previous nodes during a conversation. This is useful for error handling, retries, or clarifications. The level of rewind determines how far back the chatbot can go in the flow.

## What is Rewind?

Rewind functionality lets the chatbot "rewind" to revisit previous nodes. This is controlled via the **Router Configuration** tab in the node settings, where you can define how many levels back the chatbot can go.

- **Level 0**: No rewind (default behavior).
- **Level 1**: Go back one node.
- **Level 2**: Go back two nodes.
- **Level 3**: Go back up to three nodes.

## Configuring Rewind Nodes

### Steps to Enable Rewind

1. Open the **Router Configuration** tab for the desired node.
2. Locate the **Rewind Level** slider.
3. Adjust the level (0â€“3) based on how far back you want the chatbot to rewind.
4. Save the configuration.

**Example**: Set **Rewind Level 2** to allow the chatbot to go back two nodes when needed.

## How Rewind Works in Conversations

When rewind is enabled:

1. The chatbot can automatically or conditionally return to previous nodes based on user input or flow logic.
2. The conversation context is maintained up to the selected rewind level.

## Use Cases for Rewind

1. **Error Handling**:

   - If a tool integration fails, the chatbot can rewind to the previous node to retry or handle the error differently.

2. **Clarifications**:

   - If the user provides unclear input, the chatbot can return to the question node to ask for clarification.

3. **Flow Redirection**:
   - When a user changes their mind, the chatbot can rewind to a decision-making node to reprocess their request.

**Example Use Case**:

- **Scenario**: A scheduling chatbot asks for a time, but the user enters invalid input.
  - The chatbot rewinds to the previous node to ask the user to re-enter the time.

## Testing Rewind Functionality

1. Set up a node with a **Rewind Level** in the Router Configuration.
2. Use the **Test Tool** to simulate user inputs and verify the rewind behavior.
3. Observe how the flow returns to previous nodes and ensure the context is preserved.

## Best Practices for Rewind Nodes

- **Limit Levels**: Use rewind levels conservatively to avoid creating overly complex flows.
- **Context Management**: Ensure previous node contexts are preserved for a seamless user experience.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Simulate various scenarios to ensure the rewind functionality works as intended.

### Example Flow with Rewind

**Scenario**: A customer support chatbot:

1. **Start Node** greets the user.
2. User enters an unclear request.
   - Chatbot rewinds to the previous **Default Node** to clarify.
3. If the user corrects their input, the chatbot resumes the flow.
