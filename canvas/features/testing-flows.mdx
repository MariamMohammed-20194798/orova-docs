The **Testing Flows** feature allows you to simulate conversations and interactions with your chatbot while developing it. This helps you identify errors, validate logic, and ensure your flow behaves as expected before deployment.

---

## Why Test Your Flow?

Testing your flow ensures:

- **Accuracy**: Validate edge conditions, tool integrations, and variables.
- **User Experience**: Simulate real user interactions to optimize responses.
- **Debugging**: Identify and fix errors in the flow logic or configurations.

---

## How to Test a Flow

### 1. Open the Test Mode

1. Navigate to the **Canvas Workspace**.
2. Click on the **Test Button** (commonly located in the top-right corner).
3. A chatbot interface will open, allowing you to interact with your flow.

### 2. Simulate User Interactions

- Enter inputs as if you were a user.
- Observe the chatbot's responses and the flow progression.
- Test specific scenarios to verify edge conditions, variable usage, and tool integrations.

### 3. Debugging with the Flow Preview

- While testing, use the **Flow Preview** to visualize the current node, path, and conditions being executed.
- Identify any nodes or edges that don’t behave as expected.

---

## Key Features in Testing Mode

1. **Real-Time Feedback**:

   - See responses as they are generated.
   - Highlight issues in tool calls, conditions, or variable substitutions.

2. **Flow Navigation**:

   - View the active node and how the flow progresses.
   - Test rewinds and dynamic routing logic.

3. **Adjust and Retry**:
   - Make quick edits to nodes, tools, or conditions.
   - Retest the flow to verify fixes.

---

## Testing Edge Cases

Ensure your flow handles unusual scenarios effectively:

- **Invalid Inputs**: Test how the chatbot responds to unexpected user inputs.
- **Tool Failures**: Simulate API or tool errors and verify error handling.
- **Unmatched Conditions**: Ensure a default path exists for conditions that don’t match.

**Example**:

- If a user asks an unsupported question, the chatbot should gracefully fall back to a help or default response.

---

## Example Testing Workflow

1. Start a test session from the **Canvas Workspace**.
2. Input queries such as:
   - “What can you do?”
   - “Cancel my subscription.”
3. Observe:
   - Chatbot responses.
   - Node transitions and edge conditions.
4. Debug:
   - Fix any incorrect responses or misrouted flows.
   - Retest until the flow behaves as expected.

---

## Best Practices for Testing Flows

- **Test Incrementally**: Test small sections of your flow before combining them into a larger flow.
- **Simulate Real Scenarios**: Use realistic inputs to replicate user behavior.
- **Validate All Paths**: Ensure every edge and condition has been tested.
- **Track Logs**: Review error logs or debug information for troubleshooting.

### Example: Customer Service Chatbot Testing

1. User greets the chatbot → Test the Start Node response.
2. User asks about pricing → Validate routing to the Pricing Node.
3. User cancels the inquiry → Test the Cancel Node’s response.
4. User enters invalid input → Ensure the chatbot redirects to clarification or fallback.
