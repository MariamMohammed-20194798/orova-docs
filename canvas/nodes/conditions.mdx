In the **Canvas** feature, edges are not just connections between nodesâ€”they can also include **conditions** to enable dynamic flow control. By setting conditions on edges, you can create complex, branching flows based on user input or data.

## What are Edge Conditions?

Edge conditions define the logic that determines which node to route to next. These conditions are evaluated in real-time and allow for dynamic, context-aware routing.

**Example**:

- If the user says "Cancel,"
- If the user asks about "Pricing," route to a node that integrates pricing tools.

## Adding Conditions to Edges

### Steps to Add a Condition

1. Hover over the edge connecting two nodes and click on it.
2. A **side menu** will appear on the right-hand side.
3. In the **Condition Editor**, define the logic for the edge:
   - Use variables (e.g., `user_input`, `timestamp`) to create conditional expressions.
   - Add multiple conditions if necessary, using logical operators (`AND`, `OR`).

### Example Condition

if user_input contains any inquiry about pricing or booking, route to a node that integrates pricing tools.
