### What is Turbo Mode?

Turbo Mode is a feature in the Canvas feature that allows you to prio latency above anything else removing a core part of how the nodes work which is routing, instead you'll have a single node with all the tools, prompts attached to it saving about 100ms - 500ms on average depending on the speed of the router LLM, by default we use one of the fastest & smartest LLMs to route nodes which is Llama 3.2 running on Groq.

### How to use Turbo Mode?

When you only have 1 node in your flow we'll automatically enable Turbo and skip the router step.
