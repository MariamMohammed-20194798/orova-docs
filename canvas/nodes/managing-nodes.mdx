Managing nodes in the **Canvas** feature involves organizing and linking nodes to build seamless AI agent flows. This guide explains how to create, move, connect, and configure nodes effectively.

---

## Creating Nodes

Nodes form the building blocks of your flow. Follow these steps to add nodes to your workspace:

1. **Default Node**:

   - Drag and drop the **Default Node** from the side panel into the Canvas.
   - These nodes represent operations or decision points.

2. **Global Node**:

   - Create a **Default Node** and enable the **Global Node** toggle in the node’s settings menu.
   - Global nodes are reusable across the flow and can be accessed anywhere.

3. **End Node**:
   - Drag and drop the **End Node** to mark the endpoint of your conversation or process.

---

## Moving Nodes

Reorganize your nodes by dragging them across the Canvas:

- Click and hold the node you want to move.
- Drag it to the desired location.
- Release to position it on the grid.

_Tip_: Keep your workspace organized by aligning nodes logically based on the flow direction (left-to-right or top-to-bottom).

## Connecting Nodes with Edges

Edges define the flow of data and logic between nodes. To connect nodes:

1. Hover over a node to display the connection points.
2. Drag from a connection point to another node.
3. Release to create an edge between the nodes.

**Types of Connections**:

- **Start to Default Nodes**: Define the starting point of your flow.
- **Default to Global Nodes**: Reuse shared functionality like help prompts.
- **Default to End Nodes**: Mark the logical endpoint of the conversation.

## Editing Edges and Conditions

Edges can be customized to include conditions for dynamic routing:

1. Click on an edge to open its settings.
2. Add conditional logic based on user input or other variables.
3. Save the configuration to ensure proper branching.

**Example**:

- Route users who say "Cancel" to a Global Node for handling cancellations.
- Direct users asking about "Pricing" to a Default Node that integrates pricing tools.

## Customizing Node Behavior

Click on a node to open its customization menu, which includes:

- **Overview**: Set the node's name, description, and instructions.
- **LLM Configuration**: Adjust AI response settings like temperature and token limits.
- **Tools**: Integrate external APIs or tools for specific actions.
- **Knowledge Base**: Enable AI to retrieve relevant knowledge from a database.
- **Router Configuration**: Define conditions for branching flows.

## Testing and Optimizing the Flow

After managing nodes and edges, test your flow to ensure it works as intended:

1. Use the **Test Tool** to simulate user inputs and outputs.
2. Adjust node positions and edge configurations to fix any errors.
3. Preview the flow to visualize how users navigate through the system.

## Best Practices for Managing Nodes

- **Keep it tidy**: Organize nodes logically to maintain clarity, especially for complex flows.
- **Label everything**: Assign descriptive names to nodes and edges for easier debugging.
- **Use Global Nodes**: Reduce redundancy by centralizing reusable logic.
- **Test regularly**: Simulate scenarios to identify and fix issues early.

### Example: Complete Flow Management

**Scenario**: A customer service chatbot that:

1. Greets the user with a **Start Node**.
2. Processes user queries with **Default Nodes**.
3. Offers a reusable “Cancel” command through a **Global Node**.
4. Ends the conversation with an **End Node**.
