This section showcases how to combine Canvas features like global nodes, dynamic conditions, and rewind levels to create powerful, dynamic chatbot flows.

## Example 1: Multi-Step Booking

**Scenario**: A chatbot for scheduling appointments that handles errors and provides user-friendly navigation.

### Flow Overview:

1. **Start Node**: Greets the user and collects their initial details.
2. **Dynamic Conditions**: Routes users to different booking steps based on input.
3. **Global Node**: Uses a reusable “Cancel” node to handle cancellations at any step.
4. **Rewind Levels**: Allows users to go back and correct inputs if needed.

**How It Works**:

- If the user provides invalid details, the chatbot rewinds to the input step.
- If the user says "Cancel," the chatbot routes to the global Cancel Node.

## Example 2: Personalized Recommendations

**Scenario**: An e-commerce chatbot providing tailored product recommendations.

### Flow Overview:

1. **Start Node**: Retrieves user preferences using global variables (e.g., `user_name`, `shopping_category`).
2. **Dynamic Conditions**: Suggests products based on user preferences and input.
3. **Global Node**: Provides a reusable Help Node for FAQs.
4. **End Node**: Concludes with a personalized thank-you message.

**How It Works**:

- The chatbot dynamically suggests products by matching user input with a product database.
- Users can ask for help or clarification at any time using the Help Node.

## Example 3: Error Handling with Rewind

**Scenario**: A support chatbot that manages errors and retries while preserving context.

### Flow Overview:

1. **Start Node**: Welcomes the user and asks for their issue.
2. **Default Node**: Processes the issue and attempts to resolve it.
3. **Rewind Levels**: Allows retries if the tool call or logic fails.
4. **Global Node**: Routes escalated issues to a human agent or advanced support system.

**How It Works**:

- If the initial resolution fails, the chatbot rewinds to the user input step and requests clarification.
- Escalation is handled through a global node for consistent fallback behavior.

## Best Practices for Advanced Flows

- **Combine Features**: Use global nodes, dynamic conditions, and rewind levels together to maximize flexibility.
- **Test Edge Cases**: Simulate scenarios with invalid inputs, tool failures, and unmatched conditions.
- **Leverage Personalization**: Use global variables to create tailored experiences for users.
- **Simplify Logic**: Avoid overcomplicating flows; prioritize clarity and maintainability.

## Example Flow Testing

After designing advanced flows, test them thoroughly:

1. Simulate user inputs and follow the flow progression.
2. Test dynamic conditions to verify proper routing.
3. Validate rewind functionality to ensure context is preserved.
