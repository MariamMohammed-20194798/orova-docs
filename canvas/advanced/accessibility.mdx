Accessibility features in Canvas help create flexible, user-friendly chatbot flows. These include **Rewind Levels** for navigating back and **Dynamic Conditions** for tailoring user interactions.

---

## Rewind Levels

Rewind Levels allow your chatbot to revisit previous nodes during a conversation, enabling users to correct errors, retry actions, or provide additional details.

### How Rewind Levels Work:

- **Level 0**: No rewind (default behavior).
- **Level 1–3**: The chatbot can go back up to 3 previous nodes, depending on the configured level.

---

### Steps to Configure Rewind Levels:

1. Open the **Router Configuration** tab in a node’s settings.
2. Locate the **Rewind Level** slider.
3. Adjust the slider (0–3) to set the desired rewind depth.
4. Save the configuration.

**Example Use Case**:

- Set **Rewind Level 2** to allow a scheduling chatbot to retry both the date and time selection steps if the user provides invalid input.

## Dynamic Conditions

Dynamic Conditions allow your chatbot to route users based on their input or data variables, ensuring personalized and context-aware interactions.

### How Dynamic Conditions Work:

1. Add conditions to edges between nodes to evaluate user input or data.
2. Use logic operators (`AND`, `OR`) for complex conditions.
3. Define a default path for unmatched conditions to maintain flow continuity.

**Example Use Case**:

- If `user_input contains 'pricing'`, route to the Pricing Node.
- If `user_input contains 'help'`, route to the Help Node.
- Otherwise, route to a Fallback Node.

---

### Steps to Add Dynamic Conditions:

1. Click on an edge between two nodes to open the **Condition Editor**.
2. Define conditions using available variables or user inputs.
3. Test the conditions to verify correct routing.

## Testing Accessibility Features

### Rewind Levels:

- Simulate scenarios where users need to correct mistakes or retry actions.
- Ensure context is preserved when the chatbot rewinds to previous nodes.

### Dynamic Conditions:

- Test all possible user inputs to ensure conditions route correctly.
- Verify the default path handles unmatched inputs gracefully.

---

## Best Practices for Accessibility Features

- **Set Default Paths**: Always define a fallback route to prevent dead ends in the flow.
- **Limit Rewind Levels**: Avoid excessive rewinds that might confuse users.
- **Test Frequently**: Simulate various scenarios to validate edge cases and unexpected inputs.
- **Use Clear Logic**: Keep conditions simple and descriptive to enhance maintainability.

### Example Flow with Accessibility Features

**Scenario**: A customer support chatbot:

1. **Start Node**: Greets the user.
2. **Dynamic Conditions**: Routes users to specific nodes based on their queries.
3. **Rewind Levels**: Allows users to retry or modify their input if needed.
4. **End Node**: Summarizes and concludes the interaction.
