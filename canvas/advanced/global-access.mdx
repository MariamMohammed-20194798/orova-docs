Global access allows you to create nodes and variables that can be reused across the entire flow. This feature simplifies flow design, reduces redundancy, and enhances scalability.

## What is Global Access?

Global access in Canvas includes:

- **Global Nodes**: Reusable logic blocks accessible from any part of the flow.
- **Global Variables**: Data that persists across all nodes, enabling dynamic and personalized interactions.

---

## Creating Global Nodes

Global nodes can handle common tasks like “Help” or “Cancel” commands.

### Steps to Create a Global Node:

1. Open the **Overview** tab for any node.
2. Toggle the **Global Node** switch.
3. Configure the node as needed (e.g., prompts, tools, routing).

**Example Use Case**:

- A "Cancel" node that stops the current process and provides a summary to the user.
- A "Help" node that delivers consistent responses to user queries.

## Using Global Variables

Global variables are useful for storing data like user information or session states.

### Steps to Create Global Variables:

1. Open the **Variable Drawer**.
2. Create a variable and toggle the **Global** option.
3. Use the variable in any node or text editor with the `{` shortcut.

**Example**:

```plaintext
Hello {user_name}, how can I assist you today?
```

## Best Practices for Global Access

- **Use Descriptive Names**: Clearly label global nodes and variables to avoid confusion.
- **Centralize Reusable Logic**: Use global nodes for tasks like FAQs or cancellations to streamline flow design.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure global features behave consistently across the flow.
- **Avoid Overuse**: Reserve global nodes and variables for frequently used functions to maintain clarity.

### Example Flow with Global Access

**Scenario**: A customer service chatbot:

1. **Start Node**: Greets the user.
2. **Default Node**: Handles specific queries like “Order Status.”
3. **Global Node**: Offers a reusable "Help" command available at any point.
4. **Global Variables**: Personalizes the experience using data like `user_name` or `order_id`.
