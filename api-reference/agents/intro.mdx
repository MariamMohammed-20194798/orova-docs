## Authorization
- You can either use your workspace secret or agent secret to authorize any request for agents.

## Agent Platforms
- If your agent is VF type we recommend directly using the Voiceflow's API for querying the KB.
- You can currently interact with VG through either the built in AI engine or through Voiceflow, the <strong>agentPlatform</strong> defines how the agent will interact and function across the whole service.
- The [interact API of voiceflow](https://developer.voiceflow.com/reference/stateinteract-1) inspires how we interact with VF/VG agents, when you do an interact POST request the <strong>action</strong> property functions the same as that on Voiceflow's end. 

## Knowledge Base
- The knowledge base is a collection of documents that the agent can use to answer user queries.
- You can either search the KB or directly search the vector store to reutnr the most highest similarity chunks.
- By default all agents have a <strong>1536 dimension</strong> vector store, the text inserted is also chunked into <strong>1024 characters with overlapping of 50 chars</strong>, using the langcahin [recursiveTextSplitter](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/recursive_text_splitter)

## Conversations
- All the transcripts of any channel are stored by default.
- You can also insert a new conversation transcript to the agent yourself (although not recommended as its done automatically when you interact across any channel)
- **Popular usecase for the conversations API is to export the conversations and send them via email or in a google sheet.**

## Analytics
- The analytics API is used to get the analytics of the agent, you can get the analytics of the agent by day, week, month, or year.
- You can also insert your own analytics data to the agent.
- There are 2 types of analytics that we store:
    - **Load Analytics**: Analysation of your website traffic if you deploy using the popup, even if the user doesn't interacts with the agent it still records useful insights liek geo-analytics.
    - **Conversation Analytics**: Whenever the user starts interacting with the agent the conversation analytics kicks in to gather information like interactions number or average time per conversation.
