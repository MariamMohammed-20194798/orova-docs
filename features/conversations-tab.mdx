<img src="/images/left_section_shots.png" alt="Left Panel" width="300" />
The left panel provides a list of all conversations, date, platform and offers various sorting options.

### Conversation Fields

Each conversation in the list displays the following information:

<Steps>
<Step title="ID" icon="id-card">
 Unique identifier for each user (auto-generated or set via the [API](/api-reference))
</Step>
<Step title="Interactions" icon="comments">
 Number of user messages in the current chat
</Step>

<Step title="Timestamp" icon="clock">
Start time of the conversation
</Step>
<Step title="Channel" icon="wifi">
The channel were the conversation took place (Website, discord, instagram etc. See [integrations](/integration/Channels/discord) for more information.) This is viewed as the TV screen on the left side.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Sorting Options 

There are three ways of sorting your conversations. All of them can be used in conjunction withy each other.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Time-based Sorting">
    - Recent: Display newest conversations first
    - Oldest: Display oldest conversations first
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Interaction-based Sorting">
    - More: Sort by highest number of interactions
    - Less: Sort by lowest number of interactions
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tag-based Filtering">
    Filter conversations using custom or predefined tags
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>



## Central Panel: Conversation Transcript

The central panel displays the selected conversation transcript and offers session management features.

<img src="/images/middle_section_shots.png" alt="Central Panel" width="700" />

<Steps>
  <Step title="Session Selection" icon="chevron-down">
    Choose from sessions by **ID** using the list at the top of the panel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Conversation Flow" icon="comments">
    Review the back-and-forth messages between the user and AI agent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pin Session UI" icon="thumbtack">
    Click the `pin icon` in the upper right to keep the session UI visible while scrolling. Handy when a user has many sessions to go through.
  </Step>
</Steps>
<Note>
  A new session **starts** each time a user with an `ID` initiates a conversation on your website. Because of this, one user might have many sessions.
</Note>
## Right Panel: Conversation Management

The right panel provides tools for managing tags, using the handoff feature or sharing conversations via transcript URL.

<img src="/images/right_section_shots.png" alt="Right Panel" width="400" />


<Steps>
  <Step title="Transcript URL" icon="link">
    Share specific conversations easily with a unique URL for each conversation. This is especially useful during the demo phase, as sharing a conversation with a client for feedback is more effective than presenting an agent that's still a work in progress.
<Tip>
  If configured, **URLs** are hosted on your agency's [domain](/whitelabeling/agency/custom-domain) and will always be whitelabeled. 
</Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handoff Takeover" icon="phone">
    For information on live agent handoff, please refer to our Handoff Documentation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pin Session UI" icon="thumbtack">
    Click the `pin icon` in the upper right to keep the session UI visible while scrolling. Handy when a user has many sessions to go through.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Using Tags

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Creating Custom Tags">
    1. Click the `+` icon
    2. Enter a name for your **custom tag**
    3. Add as many tags as needed
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Predefined Tags">
    - Good Example: Marks with a checkmark
    - Bad Example: Marks with an X
    - Save for Later: Marks with a flag
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
