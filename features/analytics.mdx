GeoAnalytics tracks unique website traffic, capturing all IPs that access your site. While it doesn't directly measure agent usage, it provides insights into the total number of visitors, with a percentage of these visitors likely engaging in conversations with your agent.

Enabling **GeoAnalytics** incurs an additional credit cost of 0.1 per request on your website.
