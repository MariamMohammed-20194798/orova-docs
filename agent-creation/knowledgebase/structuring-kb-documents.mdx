    Proper document structure improves readability for both humans and AI (GPT models from OpenAI read markdown best, while [anthropic models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags) read XML). We recommend using a clear hierarchy with headings, subheadings, and bullet points.

    ```markdown Example structure using markdown:

    - Navigating the user interface 

    ## 4. Advanced Features 
    - Custom settings 
    - Integration with other devices 

    ## 5. Troubleshooting

    <Tip> 

      Consistent structure across documents helps the AI agent quickly locate and extract relevant information, leading to more accurate and context-aware responses. **To quickly reformat documents, feed the text to an LLM**.

## Adding Descriptions and Tags

    Each of the text ingestion methods explained above all include the following fields to enhance your knowledge base's searchability and efficiency: 

# 
<Card title="Document Description" icon="pen">
   Write a brief (2-3 sentences) summary of the document's content. For example: 

    ``` 

      "This document outlines our company's customer return policy, including eligibility criteria, timeframes, and refund processes." 

    ``` 
</Card>
  # 
<Card title="Tags" icon="hashtag">
  Tags Add relevant `keywords` that describe the document's main topics. For instance: 

<img></img>
     

    ``` 

      customer-service, returns, refunds, policy 

    ``` 

    
<img></img>

</Card>
      # 

    <Info> 

      These descriptions and tags help the LLM  understand the context and relevance of each document, improving the accuracy of information retrieval. **We recommend** doing both for best possible retrieval and output.
