  The Preview KB feature allows you to test your knowledge base, experiment with different chunking options, and try out various AI models directly within your agent's interface.

### Accessing Preview KB
<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Knowledge Tab">
    Open your agent's dashboard and select the 'Knowledge' tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Locate Preview KB">

## Using the Debug Screen




The debug screen is a powerful tool for testing how your agent's utlizises its knowledge. Here's the details you can see:
#
<Accordion title="Sample Debug Screen">

**Starting tool**: Input variable with the users question.    **Query:** The users query sent to the LLM.
**Parent Document metadata:** The name and description of the document, used for better context to the LLM.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Returned Chunks" icon="puzzle-piece">
    View all text chunks that match your query, along with their similarity scores.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Document Information" icon="file-lines">
    See the source document name and description for each chunk retrieved.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Token Usage" icon="calculator">
    Monitor both input and output token consumption for each query.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Model Performance" icon="chart-line">
    Evaluate how different [AI models](AImodels) perform with your knowledge base.

### Understanding retrieval details
The retrieval details makes for advanced control over your agents usage, with detailed information about each chunk, tokens and LLM. The <Tooltip tip="A similarity score measures how closely a chunk of text matches your query. Higher scores indicate greater relevance.">similarity scores</Tooltip> help you gauge the relevance of returned chunks to your query. This is crucial for retrieving the most useful information and for using the <Tooltip tip="The combined tokens from your query and the relevant chunks retrieved from the knowledge base.">input</Tooltip> and <Tooltip tip="The number of tokens generated by the model in its response. These represent the model's answer based on the input context.">output</Tooltip> tokens efficiently. 

In the screenshots below the chunk with the highest similarity score ranked `0.683`, using **1262** input tokens and **220** to output the answer with `claude 3.5 sonnet`

<Tip>
  Monitoring token usage is especially important for cost-sensitive clients aiming to minimize credit and token consumption.
</Tip>

By leveraging the Preview KB feature and understanding the debug screen, you can fine-tune your agent's knowledge base for enhanced accuracy and cost-effectiveness. This is considered an **advanced** feature, new users and agencies typically do not need to utilize this until they have gained more experience or their use cases become more complex.
