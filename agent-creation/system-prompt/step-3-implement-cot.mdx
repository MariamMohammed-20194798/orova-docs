Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning guides AI models to break down complex tasks into logical, step-by-step processes, improving accuracy, reliability, and explainability of AI responses.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Understanding CoT">
    CoT reasoning mimics human problem-solving by encouraging the AI to:
    1. Analyze the problem
    2. Break it down into smaller, manageable parts
    3. Solve each part sequentially
    4. Combine the results to reach a final conclusion

### Implementing CoT in Prompts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Explicit Instructions">
    Tell the AI to think through the problem step-by-step. 
    Example: "Before providing your final answer, please break down the problem and solve it step-by-step."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Question Decomposition">
    Guide the AI to break down complex queries into smaller, more manageable questions.
    Example: "To solve this, let's approach it in stages. First, what are the key components of the problem? Second, how do these components relate to each other? Third, ..."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Intermediate Steps">
    Encourage the AI to show its work by providing intermediate results.
    Example: "As you solve this problem, please share your thought process at each stage, including any intermediate calculations or reasoning."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Logical Connectors">
    Use words like "therefore," "because," "as a result," to encourage logical connections between steps.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verification Prompts">
    Ask the AI to verify its own work.
    Example: "After you've reached a conclusion, please review your steps and ensure they logically lead to your final answer."
  </Step>
