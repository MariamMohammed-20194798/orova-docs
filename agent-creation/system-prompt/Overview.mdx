Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective instructions for AI models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). A well-designed prompt can significantly enhance the quality, relevance, and safety of AI-generated responses. This guide will walk you through the key concepts and best practices in prompt engineering.

<Info>Rememeber to always include the variables `{kb_context}` and `{about_context}` in your prompt or else the agent wont know the retrieved chunks from the RAG.</Info>  



### Key Concepts   

  #  


<Accordion title="Chain of Thought (CoT) Reasoning">   


Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning is a technique that involves breaking down complex problems into a series of intermediate steps. This approach helps the AI model to:   


1. Understand the problem more thoroughly   


2. Show its reasoning process   


3. Arrive at more accurate conclusions   

 
 

**Example:**   

 

```   

Human: What's the result of 25 * 18?   


AI: Let's approach this step-by-step:   

 
1. First, let's break down 25 * 18 into (20 + 5) * 18   


2. Now we can calculate:   


   a) 20 * 18 = 360   


   b) 5 * 18 = 90   


3. Adding these results:   


   360 + 90 = 450   


Therefore, 25 * 18 = 450   


```

<Accordion title="Few-Shot Learning">   



Few-shot learning is a technique where you provide the AI with a small number of examples to guide its understanding of the task. This can be particularly useful when you want the AI to follow a specific format or style in its responses.   

 


- One-shot learning: Providing one example   


- Two-shot learning: Providing two examples   


- Few-shot learning: Providing a few (typically 3-5) examples   

 
 

**Example:**   


```   


Human: Translate the following English phrases to French. Here are two examples:   

 


English: Hello, how are you?   

French: Bonjour, comment allez-vous ?   

 

English: Where is the nearest restaurant?   

French: Où est le restaurant le plus proche ?   



Now, translate this:   

 
English: I would like to book a hotel room.   




AI: Based on the examples provided, here's the translation:   



 
English: I would like to book a hotel room.   

French: Je voudrais réserver une chambre d'hôtel.   

```
